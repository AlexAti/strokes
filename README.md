# strokes-examples

Howdy, we're open for business. Please watch your step.

This repo contains a small set of examples of how to implement a new or existing [d3 visualization](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery) with the clojurescript [strokes library](https://github.com/dribnet/strokes). 

Current examples:

 * [voronoi clipping](http://s.trokes.org/4760896)
 * [rotating voronoi](http://s.trokes.org/4744126)
 * [(your own example here?)](http://s.trokes.org/)
 
To get started, clone this repo, copy your favorite example,

    lein cljsbuild auto

and then open public/index.html and start hacking.

Questions, feedback, and merge requests welcome.
